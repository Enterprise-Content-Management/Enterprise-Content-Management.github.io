# Documentum REST Hackathon

Welcome to the Documentum REST Hackathon!

Feel free to walk in, choose a machine, and start a tutorial. Ask for help at any time.

## Tutorials

There are three tutorials:

* [Introduction to Documentum REST](../../hackathon/documentum-rest/MMTM Hackathon Documentum REST Introduction.pdf)
  teaches the Documentum REST API using Postman.
* [Developing an Angular App with Documentum REST](../../hackathon/documentum-rest/MMTM Hackathon Documentum REST Angular.pdf)
  teaches how to write an Angular app that uses Documentum.
  It walks you through the process, providing guidance for each step.
* [Developing an Angular App with Documentum Spring Data REST](../../hackathon/documentum-rest/MMTM Hackathon Documentum Spring Data.pdf)
  teaches how to write an Angular app using Spring Data REST
  instead of the Documentum REST API.

## REST APIs for Documentum

Documentum supports three REST APIs, which are used for different purposes.

* [Documentum REST](../rest/index.html) has the best support for Documentum, providing more features
  than the other REST APIs.  It is supported as a commercial product.
* [CMIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cmis) is an industry standard
   that is supported by several CMIS vendors. It is not as feature-rich as Documentum REST, and is
   used for interoperability.  It is supported as a commercial product.
* [Spring Data REST](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/)
   is an API that can be used with many databases and other content sources.  It is not as feature-rich
   as Documentum REST, and is used for interoperability in Spring applications.  It is open source,
   and is not supported as a commercial product.
